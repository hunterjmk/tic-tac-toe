# tic-tac-toe

Hello Y'all,

On to another project. This one is a head spinner. Literally. In projects that have passed, I had an idea of what to do in my head.

I've got nothing today. This tic tac toe game has me working with objects and factories for the first time. I'm still in the dark about how I am gonna link all the components of the logic.

Anyway, I promise to try even if it takes months to get it.

Cheers!
